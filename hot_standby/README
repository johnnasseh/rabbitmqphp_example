Hot Standby server:

To setup the hot standby machines keepalived was used
The documentation on the program:
https://keepalived.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

In the shell you type:

sudo apt install keepalived

sudo apt install libipset13

Then you create of conf file with

sudo vim etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

Then the conf file is structured like this



global_defs {
script_user root
enable_script_security
}
vrrp_script chk_mysql {
    script "/usr/local/bin/check_mysql.sh" # path to health check script
    interval 2
    weight -20                        # decrease priority if check fails
}


vrrp_instance name {                  #name has to match between paired machines
    state MASTER        #MASTER for main machine BACKUP for backup
    interface zth6rkm5gu
    virtual_router_id 51               # must be the same on both servers
    priority 100                       # higher priority means it's the primary but higher priority is tied to lower number
    advert_int 1
    unicast_src_ip 127.000.000.001      #ip of your machine
    unicast_peer {
        127.000.000.002             #ip of paired machine
}

    authentication {
        auth_type PASS
        auth_pass password              #password is max 8 characters
    }
    virtual_ipaddress {
        127.000.000.003                # virtual ip that your application will connect to
    }
    track_script {
        chk_mysql                      # health check script
    }
}


Afterwards do 

Sudo systemctl enable keepalived

To start it on startup

If 1 pc goes down then the designated backup will take over the designated virtual ip from this conf file. The backup will stay the main until the main is available to go up again since it has a lower priority
